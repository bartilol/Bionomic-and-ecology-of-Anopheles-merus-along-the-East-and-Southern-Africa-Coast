Description: 
[Malaria transmission persists despite the scale up of interventions such as long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and Indoor residual spraying (IRS). Understanding the entomological drivers of transmission is key for the design of effective and sustainable tools to address the challenge.  Recent research findings indicate a shift in vector populations from the notorious Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto as a dominant vector to other species as one of the factors contributing to the persistence of malaria transmission. However, there are gaps in literature regarding the minor vector species which are increasingly taking a lead role in malaria transmission. Currently the minor malaria vectors have behavioural plasticity which allows for their evasion of vector control tools currently in use. To address this, we have reviewed the role of Anopheles merus, a salty water mosquito species that is becoming an important vector of malaria transmission along the East and Southern Africa coast. We performed literature review from PubMed and Google scholar and reviewed over 50 publications relating to Anopheles merus bionomics, taxonomy, spatial-temporal distribution and its role in malaria transmission. What we found is that An. merus is an important vector of malaria and that it contributes to residual malaria transmission due to its exophilic tendencies, insecticide resistance, and densities that peak during the dry seasons as the freshwater mosquitoes decline. Spatial and temporal studies have also showed that this species has been increased its geographical range, densities and vectorial capacity overtime. In this review we highlight the resting behaviour and breeding habitats of this mosquito which could be targeted for surveillance studies and control interventions.]

5. METHOD and PROCESSING 
--------------------------  
[Search strategy and selection criteria
The electronic database: PubMed and Google scholar were searched for articles documenting Anopheles merus using the search phrases “Anopheles merus” and “saltwater Anopheles gambiae”. All the documents were screened and assessed to determine whether they had any data on vector densities, breeding sites, vectorial capacity and the coordinates of mosquito collection sites.
Data analysis
Data was extracted from the articles and stored in a Microsoft Excel file. The coordinate data was converted into a similar format (Decimal Degrees) using the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) Coordinate Converter. Statistical analysis and data visualisation was carried out using the R software. Comparisons between the different mosquito counts was done using Kruskal-Wallis test. 
The mosquito population structure in each of the sites was analysed using the following ecological parameters: population abundance (total number of mosquitoes per site), species richness (measure of the number of species per site), species evenness (measure of how homogenous a community is in terms of abundance of all its species) and species diversity (Shannon-Weiner index, Simpson dominance index and Margalef’s index). The publication is in press at the time of deposit]
